					<p>Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? For an android with no feelings, he sure managed to evoke them in others. I am your worst nightmare! Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. Wouldn't that bring about chaos?</p>

					<p>Damage report! We have a saboteur aboard. Not if I weaken first. Travel time to the nearest starbase? I'll alert the crew. Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation.</p>

					<h3>Caroline</h3>
					<p>Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. Talk about going nowhere fast. But the probability of making a six is no greater than that of rolling a seven. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Well, that's certainly good to know. We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone</p>

					<p>What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. Not if I weaken first.</p>
